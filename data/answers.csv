Next would be socializing. I can be an antagonistic person ,:3 not always intentionally, but I can rub people the wrong way. And it goes the same with a DnD party.

As a DM, creating a believable world and retaining the verisimilitude of things can seem an impossible feat or even terrifying, at first. A land full of monsters and magic couldn't possibly be real, let alone the possibility to maintain that illusion of realness for the other people that you're playing with. Yet, even in our own world, as blasé as it might appear, there are things that many people willingly accept as reality without necessarily knowing why they are the way that they are. The anatomy of plants and their evolutionary paths and why certain plants grow the way that they do or look the way that they do is a perfect example of that. There are botanist out there in the world, but most day to day people don't find a strong inkling to go leisurely study a topic like that, a topic mind you that I never would have broached if not for a desire brought on by my inclusion of some cool fungus monsters in a D&D game. Role playing games, to me, are a window to a fantastical world, but sometimes they behave like a mirror and reflect back some truth of the fantastical nature of our own world and our own collective history back to the players. That's a very long winded way, I guess, of me saying that discovering cool stuff in D&D or other role playing games and that feeling that you get when you make a discovery or are around when someone else you know makes a cool discovery fostered in me a desire to go learn about other cool stuff outside of role playing games, because sometimes its even more fantastical than fantasy-land is."

As a GM, organising and playing D&D has been a constant reminder to me to be aware of others and to take responsibility for my actions.
As a relatively inexperienced GM I've learned that narratives can not be treated in the same way in different mediums. When I made a particular blunder of depriving my players of agency in a kobayashi maru type scenario I understod the frustrations of my players and sided with them by doubling my efforts to improve their experience of the game. As a player, I've learned to immediately deal with a conflict of interest by calmly explaining any issues and asking for empathy, even if other players do no concede to reasons unless they too have felt negatively affected.
On a more general note, organising D&D has drastically improved my time management and organisational skills."

In science I found I was ahead because I had adjudicated fires and explosions, time and distance, weather effects, etc. Having first used multiplication, fractions, and calculation of averages in play, I ended up with a degree in mathematics. Most importantly, I am able to organize and lead groups of people, which every Dungeon Master must do if they are to run games.

Also, as an introvert, it really helps to get me out of my comfort zone and project myself more, be that astounding others with fantastic ideas or knocking em dead when I make a fool of myself. I have confidence in myself and can feel comfortable in either case."

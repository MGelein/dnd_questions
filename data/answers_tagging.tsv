2019/06/19 7:19:50 PM GMT+2	8	2	3	4	4	4	Never split the party. While true my serious answer would be creative problem-solving. I typically play a utility rogue. As I’m a handy-man of sorts IRL. It helps find a different approach to problem-solving. Plus getting a “sure why not” is always a nice day. Whether at work or in game. Next would be socializing. I can be an antagonistic person ,:3 not always intentionally, but I can rub people the wrong way. And it goes the same with a DnD party. Some get along some are here to just have fun. Others max-min so it’s a delicate balancing act finding where you fit with each other person and their play style. 	creative problem-solving|

It helped me understand that like in ttrpg's, some people want to play something they are not in the immediate moment, something they would like to be. (real story, I had a trans friend that used ttrpg's to get a feel for their desired gender, and because of ttrpg's decided to go through with the change)	support understanding|empathy

How to better make choices socially and statistically that will yield the results that I find most beneficial.   How to analyze and understand statistical data through the dice rolling.  How to write more neatly.  I learned a lot about socialization also that people want to put themselves, or in the vernacular... be in a party... with good aligned people more than they want to be with evil aligned.  That alignment in a political spectrum doesn't have to be Lawful/Stupid, and that there are degrees to belief from mild support to outright zealotry.  I could go on...

Also, it's good practice for your poker face when your players throw a wrench into your plans... or fall right into a really stupid trap.  It's great watching your friends have fun.

The act of requiring him to engage in any work outside of face-to-face fun, like putting together a character sheet, caused him to show his true colors. Without D&D I probably would have invested significantly more time and money into a relationship that was never going to pay off.

2019/06/20 6:56:56 AM GMT+2	21	3	4	4	3	5	Playing role playing games has instilled a desire in me to learn about why things are the way that they are. As a DM, creating a believable world and retaining the verisimilitude of things can seem an impossible feat or even terrifying, at first. A land full of monsters and magic couldn't possibly be real, let alone the possibility to maintain that illusion of realness for the other people that you're playing with. Yet, even in our own world, as blasé as it might appear, there are things that many people willingly accept as reality without necessarily knowing why they are the way that they are. The anatomy of plants and their evolutionary paths and why certain plants grow the way that they do or look the way that they do is a perfect example of that. There are botanist out there in the world, but most day to day people don't find a strong inkling to go leisurely study a topic like that, a topic mind you that I never would have broached if not for a desire brought on by my inclusion of some cool fungus monsters in a D&D game. Role playing games, to me, are a window to a fantastical world, but sometimes they behave like a mirror and reflect back some truth of the fantastical nature of our own world and our own collective history back to the players. That's a very long winded way, I guess, of me saying that discovering cool stuff in D&D or other role playing games and that feeling that you get when you make a discovery or are around when someone else you know makes a cool discovery fostered in me a desire to go learn about other cool stuff outside of role playing games, because sometimes its even more fantastical than fantasy-land is.

These are by far outweighed by the more useful ability to consider things from another person's point of view. Role-playing, after all, is a continuous exercise in imagining how another person might act and feel in a situation, and it is easy to extrapolate this into an improved empathy for others in day-to-day life.

As a GM, organising and playing D&D has been a constant reminder to me to be aware of others and to take responsibility for my actions.As a relatively inexperienced GM I've learned that narratives can not be treated in the same way in different mediums. When I made a particular blunder of depriving my players of agency in a kobayashi maru type scenario I understod the frustrations of my players and sided with them by doubling my efforts to improve their experience of the game. As a player, I've learned to immediately deal with a conflict of interest by calmly explaining any issues and asking for empathy, even if other players do no concede to reasons unless they too have felt negatively affected.On a more general note, organising D&D has drastically improved my time management and organisational skills.

In school I knew more words than others, and when studies turned to mythology and medieval history, I found I had already learned those things. In science I found I was ahead because I had adjudicated fires and explosions, time and distance, weather effects, etc. Having first used multiplication, fractions, and calculation of averages in play, I ended up with a degree in mathematics. Most importantly, I am able to organize and lead groups of people, which every Dungeon Master must do if they are to run games.

I've learned that just because someone isn't like you, doesn't mean you can't be friends. Problem solving, a greater understanding of the importance of diversity, improved mental health, I can link all of that to TTRPGs. And it hasn't even been hard work- it has come naturally in the form of playing a game.

Having to add dice together all the time has improved my ability to do so fairly significantly, to the point where other people are capable of noticing it. I still get it wrong or run across numbers I just can't add together or divide (resistance/saves), but overall its improved considerably.

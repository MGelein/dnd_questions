# dnd_questions
Results for the d&amp;d survey that was answered by >900 people on r/DND and r/DNDNext

This repo is mostly necessary for any data cleanup and tagging of the open questions. Probably mostly useful for internal use in the research project, however anyone can download the data.

# How To Start Tagging
- Clone the repo
- `cd` into the repository root folder and run `npm install dev`
- from that same location run `node label` to start labelling the answers.
